move the netconn here and separate it for few files
there can be /sv abd /cl folder, depends on amount of data
for now not neccessary maybe

each folder may have an include.h to get all files together 
and refer to eachh folder include
so you can make a function to parse all include files from folders
that's the basics of having structure
