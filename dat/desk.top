this folder contains data , client , server, math

/dat
//cl
//sv
//mt

for some reason git apps don't see new empty folders, it is
 
/gui 
/net //sv //cl  
/snd 
/inp 

it's not the final and best solution, but something for a start
basically it doesn't matter on the name of folders
but you can use this naming to refer to some functions in other parts
and you will know where to check that , because of the naming
